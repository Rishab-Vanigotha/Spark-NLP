# Spark-NLP
- This is an Cyber Bullying detection using SparkNLP
- We have used Universal Sentence Encoder that converts raw text into sentence embeddings without any prior text preprocessing.
- built a deep neural network and fine tuned with various parameters
- then we scrape latest tweets using snscrape which has no limitations to ingest tweets unlike other libraries
- upcoming plan is to implement this model on real time tweets and applying this in client server model
